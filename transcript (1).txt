Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:08:44 AM): Hi, my name is Susarah. How can I assist you today? 
Me (9/25/2020, 8:09:20 AM): I have 2 students who try to register and gain access to my course but they are told the course code is already used.  I have not used all of my subscriptions. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:09:38 AM): I’m sorry you are having this problem. Let’s see if there is anything we can do to help the situation. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:09:55 AM): Do you have the copy of their access codes professor? 
Me (9/25/2020, 8:10:29 AM): Yes, one moment as I find it 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:10:37 AM): Okay, thank you.

Me (9/25/2020, 8:12:47 AM): Yes, one moment as I find that info

Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:14:26 AM): Thank you. 
Me (9/25/2020, 8:15:09 AM): The other was not even able to get into my course yet.  He was previously in different course at my school, just not on my roster 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:15:22 AM): Alright. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:16:34 AM): As I have checked the access code that they trying to register already reached the maximum cashed ins which is 155 cash ins. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:17:09 AM): That is why they are getting an error message that the access code is already used. There's no more available cash ins to use. 
Me (9/25/2020, 8:17:25 AM): I have made students inactive that have left the course.  Does that make those redemptions available again? 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:18:55 AM): I'm sorry once they already registered the access code it will reduce the available cash ins. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:19:28 AM): I highly suggest is to contact the Sales Representative to request another batch access code for your students. 
Me (9/25/2020, 8:19:42 AM): We are a k-12 district and we have schedule changes frequently.  It seems like we should be able to remove students and replace them with new ones once the kids get settled in the proper courses. 
Susarah M (9/25/2020, 8:20:20 AM): I understand but the access code has already used and the access is non transferrable.
